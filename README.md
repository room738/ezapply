## "how does it work?"

ezapply is run by sam, a very intelligent, ambitious, amorphous multicoloured blob. her brain is made of spaghetti and huggingface transformers.

sam is what the kids call an "AI" -- an application inexpert, one who needs your help to get better at filling out applications. luckily shes a fast learner, and if you call on her after filling out a job application, she will soak up your information and  so she can be smarter next time.

if you call on her when the page is empty,  she will fill out the page on your behalf to the best of her ability. she retains your basic information, geographic preferences, and common documents to make it believable.

sam has to remember a lot about you but doesn't want to pry, so she keeps all your files on a private repo on your github account, along with other useful information like time saved and a log of your applications.
